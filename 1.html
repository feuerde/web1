    For example, another thing to consider is the attributes of tags which play another significant role in helping customize and define the tag. Other aspects of it are character-based data types, character references, and entity references. Typically, most tags come in pairs as mentioned before and the first tag is called the start or opening tag while the second one is called the end or closing tag. an also represent empty elements and are therefore unpaired, also as mentioned above.
